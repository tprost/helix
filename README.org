Meow is yet another modal editing mode for Emacs.

Meow aims to blend modal editing into Emacs with minimal interference
with its original key-bindings, avoiding most of the hassle introduced
by key-binding conflicts. This leads to lower necessary configuration and
better integration. More is achieved with fewer commands to remember.

Key features compared to existing solutions:

- Minimal configuration -- build your own modal editing system
- No third-party dependencies ([[file:GET_STARTED.org][try it without touching your configuration]])
- Doesn't occupy too many keys
  - Much easier to remember for people trying modal editing
  - More keys available for your own key-bindings
  - Most of the time, you don't even need to hold shift!
- Lightning fast (unlike Evil)
- Minimizes modifier usage (e.g. =SPC x f= for =C-x C-f=) inspired by [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/god-mode][god-mode]]
- Better workflow for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html][kmacro]] application at multiple locations
- Interactive selection manipulation and expansion inspired by avy
- Selection as top-tier object, and keybindings built around selection
- Compatible with the vanilla Emacs keymap (or any other keymap from any package)
- Effortless uniform keymaps across modes
- Key-binding conflict handling made easy
